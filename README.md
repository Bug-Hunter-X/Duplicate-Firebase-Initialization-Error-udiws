# Duplicate Firebase Initialization
This example demonstrates a common error in Firebase projects: initializing the Firebase app multiple times with different configurations. This leads to unexpected behavior and errors. The solution focuses on ensuring a single initialization point for your Firebase app, no matter the application's structure or loading dynamics.

## Steps to Reproduce the Bug:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Execute `node duplicateFirebaseInit.js`. Observe the error message.

## Solution:
The `duplicateFirebaseInitSolution.js` file showcases the correct approach by using a singleton pattern to ensure that `initializeApp` is called only once, regardless of multiple imports or loading sequences.
